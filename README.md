# Coursework on Mid-Level Vision: Image Segmentation

---

## 1. Introduction
This coursework provides the opportunity to design and implement a computer vision algorithm that can segment images. If you require any clarification on these instructions, please use the forum on KEATS.

---

## 2. The Task
Your code needs to segment colour images into meaningful parts. To assess the quality of the segmentations your code produces, its output will be compared to ground-truth segmentations generated by human observers.

At the end of these instructions are examples of 12 colour images. Next to each are four binary images showing the boundaries between different regions of the image as identified by four different human observers. Notice that different human observers do not always agree on how to segment the same image. Hence, it is impossible to produce an algorithm that performs this task perfectly. Furthermore, it is extremely difficult to find an algorithm that will work across different images. An algorithm might work well for one image but produce very poor results on others.

You should implement a method that works reasonably well across a number of images rather than attempting to produce perfect results on one or two images. Consider using any of the methods for image segmentation covered in week 5 and/or methods of edge detection covered in earlier weeks. You are also free to use other methods not covered in this module.

A zip file containing the training images and the human segmentations shown at the end of these instructions (plus some additional human segmentations) is available from the module's KEATS webpage. These images are provided primarily to allow you to develop your code and evaluate its performance.

## 3. System Requirements
Your code must include an m-file called **`segment_image.m`**. The main function in this file should have the following definition:
```matlab
function [seg] = segment_image(I)
```
This function takes one input, **`I`**, which is a MATLAB variable storing an RGB colour image (e.g., created using `I=im2double(imread('im1.jpg'));`).

The input variable contains the image to be segmented. This variable should not be overwritten, replaced, or ignored by your code. Your code must run entirely automatically and not require user intervention (e.g., for setting parameter values).

The output variable, **`seg`**, must be a 2-dimensional matrix with the same number of rows and columns as **`I`**. It must be in one of the following formats:
1. A binary image containing only zeros and ones, where values of 1 indicate boundaries between different regions of the image.
2. An image where each pixel contains a single integer value (≥1), defining the region label associated with the corresponding location in the image.

The `segment_image` function may call other functions, but not compiled code (e.g., `.exe` files). Unless the other functions are official MATLAB functions, they should be included in the same m-file or within the zip file you submit.

Your code must run on a PC (running Linux) and not require special hardware, such as a GPU or RAM exceeding 16GB.

## 4. Submission
Submit a single m-file or a single zip file containing your code and any additional files it requires to execute. Ensure that the **`segment_image.m`** file appears directly in the unzipped directory, not in a sub-directory.

Submit a one-paragraph description of the method you used. This can be in a separate PDF document or as a block of comments at the top of the **`segment_image.m`** file. Acknowledge any code you have copied or modified from online sources, books, or articles. Provide full citations or URLs for these sources. Not acknowledging other people's work constitutes plagiarism. Sharing code with fellow students is not permitted.

Submit your coursework via KEATS by the specified deadline.

---

## 5. Terms and Conditions
Distribution or sharing of your submitted code, or any code derived from it, is forbidden. By submitting your coursework, you agree to these terms.

---

## 6. Assessment
Your code will be assessed based on its accuracy in segmenting 12 testing images, which are distinct from the training images. Accuracy is measured by how well your segmentations match those produced by human observers.

True matches between your algorithm’s boundaries and human-marked boundaries will be counted, with a tolerance of 3 pixels. The higher the number of true matches, the higher your score. However, false positives and false negatives will reduce the score.

Evaluation is performed using the `evaluate.m` function, available on KEATS. You can visualise results using the `compare_segmentations.m` function, which requires the `show_results.m` and `convert_seg_to_boundaries.m` functions. Do not include these provided functions or training images in your submission; evaluation will use the instructor’s versions of these functions and unseen test images.

Marks will primarily be awarded for the accuracy of your code. Additional credit may be given for the sensibility, efficiency, and correctness of your implementation. Marks will be deducted if your code needs fixing to execute.

function [f1score,TP,FP,FN]=evaluate(boundariesPred,boundariesHuman)
%Returns the f1score quantifying the quality of the match between predicted
%and human image segmentations.

%Note both inputs are assumed to show the boundaries between image regions.

r=3; %set tolerance for boundary matching
neighbourhood=strel('disk',r,0); 

%make dilated and thinned versions of boundaries
